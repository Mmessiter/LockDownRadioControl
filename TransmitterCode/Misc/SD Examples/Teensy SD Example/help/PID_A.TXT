|This screen allows the editing of PID Advanced values for the Nexus helicopter flight controller, and probably other flight controllers that support the same MSP v1 protocol.||


The Numbers in the small yellow boxes are there to identify the parameter which you are currently editing. The edit box will display this number at the top to confirm you are editing the right one because it is easy to inadvertently select the wrong one. If you do select the wrong one, just press okay to save it unchanged.


1). First select the Bank you would like to edit using the Bank switch. After selecting a Bank  there will be a brief pause while the values for that Bank are loaded.||

2). Then edit any of the 25 values by pressing the box containing that value.||

3). Then press Save and wait a moment while updated values are sent the the flight controller and saved in its EEPROM.||

Confirm that your new values were indeed saved by moving the Bank switch briefly to another Bank and then back to the one you just edited. Check its values; because they were just read back from the flight controller. If all looks good, fly!!||
