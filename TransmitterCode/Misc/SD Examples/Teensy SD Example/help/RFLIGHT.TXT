This screen allows you to view and edit PIDs (aka Profiles) and Rates for a flight controller that runs RotorFlight open source firmware. ||

Version 2.2 or higher of Rotorflight is needed here. ||

For both Rates and PID you can select the Advanced option in order to view and edit a number of other tuning parameters.||

It is therefore envisaged that you need do only the initial setup of your helicopter using RotorFlights Configurator. Once you are at the field you can tune the flying characteristics using the transmitter with no need for a laptop.||

Also on this screen you can save the parameters to the SD card. It is recommended to do this as soon as you are happy with them. If you then edit them and realise you've made it worse, just restore the saved settings. Never restore the saved settings if you have not ever saved them! That would send junk values which is not a very good idea.||

If you use these options while NOT connected to a model, you can view and edit the parameters that have been stored on the SD card. It is recommended to do this before you restore or upload the sd card values so that you can check what it is you're sending to the model.

Saving and restoring happens one Bank at a time, and you can select any of the four possibilities. Selection of the local (SD card) bank and the Rotorflight bank is independent. Hence it is possible to copy the settings from one bank to another.

Please land and disarm the model before using this screen.
