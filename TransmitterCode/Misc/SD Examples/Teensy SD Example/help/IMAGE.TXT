Here you can choose from the avalable images for this model.||

Images must be .jpg files, and NOT Progressive. Use lower case for .jpg|
(NOT .JPG nor .jpeg etc.) ||

The files must be in a directory called Images (with upper case I) on the SD card of the Nextion display.||

The same files must also be in a directory called Images on the Teensy 4.1 SD card. The reason for this duplication is that the Nextion can display the file, but it cannot return a file list.||

We recommend keeping a copy of this directory on your computer too. ||

The resolution of each image file must be 320 width x 200 height.||

Filenames must be max 8 characters plus .jpg|
