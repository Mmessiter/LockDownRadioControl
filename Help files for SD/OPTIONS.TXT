Transmitter modes 1 and 2 are supported. Set this option first, before calibration.||

Automatic model selection will attempt to match the model's ID with one stored in a model memory.||

A receiver that boots up without a bind plug in place will connect with its own previously bound transmitter but no other transmitter. ||

When a receiver boots up with bind plug in, it will immediately bind with a nearby transmitter that's switched o n and not yet connected.||

If 'Automatic model selection' (AMS) is turned ON when connecting, all model memories are searched for a match with the connecting model's ID. If a match is found, the matched model memory is loaded.  ||

If 'Automatic model selection' (AMS) is turned OFF when connecting, the model memory that was selected does not change. ||

So when connecting to a model for the first time, manually load the correct Model memory on the transmitter before connection to receiver.||

Screen timeout will save battery while you fly by turning off the screen. To switch it back on, touch the screen anywhere. ||

Inactivity Timeout will switch off the transmitter after it's been forgotten and left on. It will never switch off while connected, nor if you move a stick or press a button.||

Low battery warning will warn you when either the transmitter or receiver battery gets low. To be safe, set it quite high.||

Number of lines to scroll refers to the help screens AND log files. When you press the 'Up' or 'Down' buttons, this defines how many lines will move.||

System page 2 allows the clock to be set.||

Hours from GMT selects your time zone. This is needed if GPS is connected as it will correct the Real Time Clock to GMT if zone is not known. ||

On System page 3:||

'QNH' means atmospheric pressure at sea level for the current time and location. This is needed for more accurate altitude readings from the BMP280 barometer, assuming one was fitted. ||

Aviation web sites will give this information for nearby airports.||

LED brightness can be 0 to 254 where zero is off and 254 is very bright.||

If the voltage reported for either battery is different from that indicated by a very accurate voltmeter, the correction needed can be entered here in 100ths of a volt.

The power-off button works immediately when there is no connection. ||

When a model is connected it must be held down for a few seconds (defined here) to switch off.||

On the front screen the connection quality indicator works by counting successful and unsuccessful packets over several seconds.| 
The number of seconds can be between one and six and is defined here.||
