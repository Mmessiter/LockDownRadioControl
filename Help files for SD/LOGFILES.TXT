This screen allows you to view and delete log files. ||

The filename for every log file is the date it was written. ||

Only one file per day is created. Each event is marked with the time it occurred, using the current time. ||

The 'Down' and 'Up' buttons will scroll the file when needed. The number of lines to scroll with each press can be defined (1-10) on the Transmitter setup (System page 1).||
