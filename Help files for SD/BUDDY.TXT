Buddy-Boxing:||

This feature allows 'dual control' which is really handy when teaching beginners to fly.||

It needs two transmitters of course, one for the 'Master' and one for the pupil ('Buddy').||

The Master uses a switch on the Master's transmitter to give control to the Buddy - and to take control back fast when pupil screws up - as they usually do.||

When using the Buddy box feature, a switch on the Master transmitter must be defined as 'Buddy'. It's probably best if this is a spring-return switch because then simply releasing the switch will return full control to the Master instantly. ||

On the Master transmitter, you can select which channels are enabled for the Buddy. Any channels not selected will remain always under the control of the Master even after selecting Buddy with the switch.||

On that same screen, near the bottom, you can control whether Master or Buddy 'switches' will be used when Buddy is in control. In general it's probably better NOT to give Buddy control of the switches, especially for a beginner. That way the Master can always control motor on/off, safety, Bank and Rates. But if the buddy is more advanced and is perhaps learning to do autorotations with a helicopter, he or she will ideally need to control these switches too when in control. When Master is in control, Master's switches are always used.

The same model memory should be loaded on both transmitters, and the Buddy (pupil) needs to know the ID of the Master transmitter. Both of these are easily achieved by sending the model memory from the Master to the pupil wirelessly. Embedded in the data sent is the needed ID of the sending transmitter as well as the ID of the model being sent.|| 

 *** The Master should save the model ID *BEFORE* sending the model memory to buddy!! *** ||

If AMS (automatic model selection) is enabled on both transmitters and both transmitters have saved the ID of the model in use, then BOTH transmitters will automatically select the correct model if either had the wrong model loaded. || 

When moving the Buddy switch, both transmitters will announce 'Master' or 'Buddy' in order to make clearer who is in control.||

The Master transmitter might also announce "Buddy with nudge" if that option was setup. This mode has buddy in control, but Master can use his own sticks to nudge gently the model if needed, rather than take over full control. The Nudge feature operates on all channels EXCEPT Collective/Throttle since these usually do not self centre.||

The wireless buddy feature is even supported when using a third party transmitter module. ||

Wired Buddy-Boxing:||

The wired buddy-boxing feature has been removed because no one wanted to use it. Wireless is much simpler and much better.
