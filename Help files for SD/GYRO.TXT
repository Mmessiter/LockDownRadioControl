PID Settings (affect responsiveness):||

PID_P - Proportional gain.|
- Too low: response feels sluggish.|
- Too high: model may oscillate.|
PID_I - Integral gain.|
- Helps correct steady-state drift or imbalance.|
- Increase slightly if the model tends to lean or drift in one direction.||
PID_D - Derivative gain.|
- Smooths rapid movements.|
- Increase to calm fast corrections; reduce if response feels delayed.||
Kalman on: Enables the Kalman filter.||
Q_angle - Trust in accelerometer angle.|
- Higher = trust accelerometer more.|
- Lower = trust gyro more.|
- If angle drifts slowly over time, increase this. If jittery, reduce.||
Q_bias - Trust in gyro drift estimate.|
- Controls how quickly gyro bias is corrected.|
- If model slowly veers off over time, increase this.|
- If noisy or jumpy, reduce.||
R_measure - Trust in accelerometer measurement.|
- Higher = assume more sensor noise.|
- Lower = rely more on accelerometer.|
- If angle is noisy, increase this. If slow to level, reduce.||
alpha - Smooths angle measurements.|
- 0.00 = no smoothing, 1.00 = very slow changes.|
- Raise if pitch/roll angles appear jittery.||
beta - Smooths gyro rates.|
- Filters the rate-of-rotation data.|
- Increase if the model overreacts to small inputs or noise.||
LPF - Low-pass filter toggle.|
- Turns on/off additional rate filtering.|
- Useful for helicopters to tame aggressive behaviour.||
Calibrate MPU6050 now! - Starts sensor calibration.|
- Place the model *still and exactly horizontal* .|
- Do not move it during calibration.|
