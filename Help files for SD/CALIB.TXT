It's critically important to use this option before setting up and flying!  ||

Also use this option again if sticks are replaced or sticks' mode is changed.||

If the transmitter is new or has a new owner, you should start by selecting 'Reset Transmitter'. This function will take a few minutes to complete. It deletes all model memories (but NOT their backup files). It also sets sticks mode to MODE 2, so if you fly MODE 1, remember to change this (under TX settings) BEFORE calibrating.||

Next calibrate the sticks and switches or knobs.||

The system needs to know the end and centre points of all the sticks and the knobs or switches. Only channels 1 - 8 need to be calibrated.||

Press the button ONCE, then move the sticks and move the knobs several times to all their extreme positions, then press the button ONCE again, then put all to their CENTRE positions and move all four TOP EDGE switches away from you before pressing it one last time to record centres and edge switch orientation.||

From his screen the hardware trim sense can also be defined. The trims might be reversed if you don't define their sense!||

Do not switch off the transmitter while calibrating it!|
