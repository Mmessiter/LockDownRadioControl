Use this screen to view a log file of many communications events.||

Log files are stored on the SD card.|
A new LOG file is started every day. Its filename is built from the date.||

You can opt to record (or not to record) when the receiver swapped transceivers.|
The minimum 'Gap' that's logged is defined here too. Gaps are in milliseconds. ||

Gaps occur when a data packet or packets fails to arrived owing to interference and/or great distance.|
The system then reconnects as fast as possible.||

Short gaps, up to 100 ms or so, are not detectable by most pilots. More than that might indicate an issue. ||

Also this screen allows the the LOG function to be switched right off - to save wear and tear on the SD card.
SD cards only last a year or so. They last longer when rarely written to. |
So a backup of the SD card's files on your computer is a very good idea.
