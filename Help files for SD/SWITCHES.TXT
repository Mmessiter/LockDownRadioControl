Here you can define the function of the four EDGE switches.||

If a switch behaves strangely, it probably still needs to be calibrated.||

When using the Buddy box feature, one switch must be defined as 'Buddy'. It's probably best if this is a spring-return switch. 

If the Buddy function is not at the ideal switch position, re-calibrate the switches and/or reverse the Buddy switch sense. 

Channels 5,6,7, and 8 can be knobs or switches. These channels are not defined here, but are defined as any other channel.
