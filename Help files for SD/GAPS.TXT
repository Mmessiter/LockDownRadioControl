|This screen shows details of reconnection times. It can be very informative. In particular it clarifies how many reconnection events were of what sort of length. ||

For example, the longest reconnection time may have occurred only once or twice whereas the majority of reconnection times were very much shorter. This can be reassuring news!||

If you see a large number of reconnection times which are greater than 100 ms, or even 250 ms, then it might be time to consider relocating your antenna, and perhaps checking for damage to the antennae on the receiver and the transmitter.||

When many models use FHSS simultaneously, frequency collisions are inevitable but they are brief as a rule because the system attempts to reconnect as quickly as possible. With this particular system reconnection times are usually extremely short. They are usually below 8 ms and sometimes below 4 ms. They only become noticeable to the pilot if they exceed about 350 ms which is approximately a third of a second.||

I suggest you don't look at this screen while flying! Look at it after you have landed but before switching off.
