This screen shows the position of all channels, and allows the editing of curves for each channel and bank.||
 
Press a button at the left or right to edit any of the 64 possible curves.||

(16 channels x 4 banks = 64.)||

Be sure to select the intended bank and model before editing a curve.||

It's possible, and frequently desirable, to copy a curve to all flight modes by means of the check box.||

The option on the Model Setup screen: 'Rates' allows you to setup three rates, each from zero to 100%. These rates are applied to every bank. So if you use 3 rates and 4 banks there will be 12 distinct setups available.
