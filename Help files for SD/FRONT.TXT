It's recommended that this screen is visible while flying a model because it shows the bank, time, trims, motor timer and battery voltages. ||

The motor timer runs automatically when the motor is running. ||

It can run forwards, or backwards from a specified number of minutes. (Under Model setup / Options).||

The timer pauses when the motor is not running and is reset to 0 when the transmitter is turned on.||

LED blue  = The radio is not trying to connect.|
LED red   = The radio is trying to connect.|
LED green = The radio is connected.||

The power button will turn the radio on and off. If the radio is connected, a (user definable) long press is needed to turn it off. This is to guard 
against the likely consequences of your accidentally hitting the button while flying a model. || 

The green connection quality indicator near the bottom of the screen shows the proportion of successful data packets as a percentage of total data packets averaged over a definable period (of 1 - 6 seconds).||

The battery indicator top right shows the transmitter battery state. |
This battery can be LiPo, Li-Ion or LiFePo4 but always 2 cells.||

The display shows the voltage PER CELL. This is because most people know immediately the 'per cell' voltage at which further discharge is a not a very good idea. 
|For LiPo and Li-Ion, it's about 3.6V. |

This battery type should be defined in 'Setup' in order to see a useful percent display.  

The battery indicator bottom left shows the receiver battery state, including per cell voltage. |

Under Model setup / Options you can set the per-cell receiver voltage below which the transmitter will announce "STOP FLYING!". About 3.6 volts is suggested.

Press 'Model setup' Or 'Transmitter setup' to change settings.
