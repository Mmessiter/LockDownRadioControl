Scroll the left side of the screen to select a model from 1 to 89.||

'Backup' creates (or overwrites) a separate file of the current model.||

Backing up a model memory is very strongly recommended once that model is setup well. When sharing model memories with other transmitters, it is the backup file that is sent. So you must hit Backup before you can share the model.||

Backup files are listed on the right hand side.||

'Restore' reads a file into the currently selected model number, overwriting whatever was there. ||

'ID check' will display receiver IDs for model memories stored, and check for any duplicates which should be avoided. ||

When AMS (automatic model selection) is turned off, or the ID of the connecting model is not stored yet, the transmitter will connect to the currently loaded model - whatever it's stored ID.||

On the main 'Model Setup' screen is the option to delete or to store the currently connected model ID. An ID cannot be stored when not connected, but it can be deleted.||

To use AMS, be sure to store the IDs of your models with the right memory.||

To 'Send' a model memory file wirelessly to another transmitter:||

(1)  Select a model number at the receive end that will be overwritten.|
(2)  Backup the model to be sent at the send end.|
(3)  Put both transmitters onto the 'Models' screen. |
(4)  Select the Backup file which you want to send. |
(5)  Press 'Receive' at the Receive end.|
(6)  WITHIN 30 SECONDS press 'Send' at the Send end.||

The transfer will create (or overwrite) the file at the receive end. ||

The received file will have the same name as the sent file.||

After sending a model memory, be sure to CHECK ALL FUNCTIONS before flying!||

Check and edit as needed BEFORE flying!
