The vario can use a BMP280 or a DPS310 pressure sensor. One or the other must be connected. It emits sounds to help the pilot know whether the model is climbing or descending.||

The vario can be enabled in any bank (1,2,3, or 4). If zero is selected then the vario is enabled in all banks.|
The vario threshold is the minimum rate of climb or decent needed to trigger a sound.|
The various spacing is the minimum change in rate of climb or descent needed to move to the next sound.|
