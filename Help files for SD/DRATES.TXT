Three rates can be setup. One of these is normally set to 100%, but all can be 0% - 200% ||

A three position edge switch can be allocated to select between rates, and/or rates can be selected according to which bank is selected.||

The rates are applied to up to eight output channels, though usually only aileron, elevator and rudder are used.||

If no switch is allocated to 'rates' then a rate of 100% is applied to all.||

Each rate uses a percentage,  0% - 200%, of the values set for the selected channels, in all banks.||

Any channel to which rates are not applied is sent as 100%.||

To leave a channel unaltered (100%), set its channel number to 0.||

After selecting channel numbers, press 'Refresh display' to display and confirm channel names.
