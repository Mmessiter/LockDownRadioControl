This screen offers the option to use a third party transmitter module plugged in at the back, instead of the built-in transceiver and the integral 'Lockdown Radio Control FHSS' protocol. ||

Using such a module allows the use of many other receiver types and their protocols, such as Spektrum. This allows the flying of 'BNF' models where for example the installed Spectrum receiver is not easily accessible. ||

The transmitter module must be of the standard 'JR' type.||

Several channel orders are offered here.||

Features such as telemetry and model-match are not supported with many third party modules; so use the timer in reverse to avoid running out of battery and be sure the correct model memory is loaded BEFORE connecting.||

When not using a module, it's best to remove it so that it does not consume power or transmit anything. Put the blank cover in its place.||

After changing the transmitter module settings, the transmitter must re-start.||

While using a third party transmitter module, the transmitter does not know when it's connected, so those options that are normally disabled or modified while connected (for safety) remain unchanged. ||

For this reason, please be extra careful while flying not to use an option that might crash the model, such as selecting a different model memory.
