This screen allows you to view and edit PIDs (aka Profiles) and Rates for a flight controller that runs RotorFlight open source firmware. ||

Version 2.2 or higher of Rotorflight is needed here. ||

For both Rates and PID you can selected the Advanced option in order to view and edit a large number of other tuning parameters.||

It is therefore envisaged that you need now do only the initial setup of your helicopter using RotorFlights Configurator. Once you are at the field you can tune the flying characteristics using this transmitter with no need for a laptop.||

Please land and disarm the model before editing these parameters.
