This screen allows you to view and edit PIDs (aka Profiles) and Rates for a flight controller that runs RotorFlight open source firmware. ||

Version 2.2 or higher of Rotorflight is needed here. ||

For both Rates and PID you can select the Advanced option in order to view and edit a large number of other tuning parameters.||

It is therefore envisaged that you need do only the initial setup of your helicopter using RotorFlights Configurator. Once you are at the field you can tune the flying characteristics using the transmitter with no need for a laptop.||

Also on this screen you can save ALL the parameters to the SD card. It is recommended to do this as soon as you are happy with them. If you then edit them and realise you've made it worse, just restore the saved settings. Never restore the saved settings if you have not ever saved them! That would send junk values which is not a very good idea.||

Please land and disarm the model before using this screen.
