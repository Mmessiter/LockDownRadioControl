This screen is for setting up Failsafe.||
If signal is lost by the receiver for >2 seconds, each CHECKED channel will go to where it was when you pressed 'Save' on this screen. ||
(Channels not checked will not move at all on loss of signal.)||

If or when connection subsequently recovers, full control is resumed.||

Failsafe data are saved AT THE RECEIVER, so use the screen ONLY WHEN CONNECTED!||
(Pressing 'Save' when not connected saves nothing at the receiver.)
